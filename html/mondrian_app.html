				Mondrian App 


				Design and concept of an interactive application
				with the subject Piet Mondrian.
				In a playful way the user can learn about his style
				and try to abstract a painting himself. Moreover
				he can discover information about Mondrain as
				an artist, his life and De Stijl.

				The whole design keeps close to Mondrians
				colours, forms and abstract ways. The main menu
				as well as the information graphics in the second
				part are generated from one of Mondrains
				paintings. Those transform a two-dimensional
				avant-garde painting into a three-dimensional
				interactive infographic.
